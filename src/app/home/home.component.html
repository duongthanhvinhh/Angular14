    Hi! My name is <strong>Vinh Tester</strong>. I help people grow in their QA careers and earn more by making it easy to learn Selenium WebDriver and test automation.
</p>
<p>
    I am a Software Testing Engineer at TMA Solutions with over 1 year of experience automating Telecom tests and a bit WebUI using Selenium WebDriver.
</p>
<p>
    My career started as a manual QA engineer and quickly became interested in automating tests. I learned Selenium and Java, used a few different testing frameworks. Now I want to switch my career to automation testing area.
</p>
<p>
    Test automation became my passion as soon as I automated my first test. And I have been automating everything, not just tests, since. I automated my job search, then I automated flight searches that help me travel cheaper, I love automating and now want
    to share my knowledge with you.
</p>
<p>
    I’m looking forward to the future of Practice Test Automation, and I’m glad to have you here!

  In today’s technology-driven world, almost every organization (whether it be a
  startup or any big tech giant) is trying to automate its core functioning or
  work processes for enhancing efficiency and productivity. Indeed,
  <i><b>from Designing to Development </b></i> or
  <i><b>from Management tasks to Business Processes</b></i
  >, Automation is setting up its space in almost every single domain. And in a
  similar context –
  <i><b>here comes the Automation Testing domain!!</b></i> Automation Testing is
  replacing the traditional Manual Testing practices by making the tedious
  testing tasks more efficient and convenient. And if you’re considering making
  a career in the Testing field, then Automation Testing will be a great move
  for you!!

  Before moving further, let’s have a brief introduction to –
  <i><b>What is Automation Testing?</b></i> So, Automation Testing is concerned
  with the process of using various tools and software to create test cases and
  their execution by considering pre-defined actions. In comparison with the
  Manual Testing process, Automation Testing offers numerous worthwhile benefits
  such as less time-consuming, better performance, less operational costs,
  scalability, and many more. Statistically, the Automation Testing market is
  all set to reach around <i><b>$30 Billion</b></i> by the year
  <i><b>2024</b></i> and the demand for highly skilled Automation Professionals
  is rising rapidly in the tech world. Furthermore, let’s take a look at several
  major <i><b>roles & responsibilities of an Automation Tester</b></i> in an
  organization:
</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 17%">
  <li>Identifies automation test cases and writes test automation scripts</li>
  <li>Responsible for the enhancement of test frameworks</li>
  <li>Monitors the defect management process</li>
  <li>
    Prepare the testing reports and collaborate with other teams as well, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="pClass">
  Now, let’s get back to the main concern –
  <i><b>How to make a career in Automation Testing?</b></i> Meanwhile, there is
  not any strict eligibility criteria or academic requirement to get into the
  Automation Testing. However, if you’re having an academic background in a
  particular domain such as
  <i
    ><b
      >Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science / Information
      Technology, etc.,</b
    ></i
  >
  it’ll be quite helpful for you as it’ll not only make you familiar with the
  fundamentals and underlying mechanism of the particular field but will also
  help you to get some ravishing career opportunities. Moreover, if we talk
  about the technical skills or hands-on experience or anything else required
  for becoming an Automation Testing Professional, below we’ve provided a
  <i
    ><b
      >thorough roadmap that covers all the approaches to make a worthwhile
      career in Automation Testing:</b
    ></i

<h3 class="pClass">
  <b>1. Get Proficient with Programming Languages</b>
  <p>
    If you’re considering that Coding or Programming skills are not essential
    for getting into Automation Testing then you’re entirely wrong!! Indeed,
    you’re required to have a sound knowledge of Programming Languages and the
    respective programming concepts. It will make you comfortable with various
    crucial jobs for Automation Testing such as Unit Testing, Task Automation,
    Code Review, and many more. Meanwhile, you can start with several most
    demanding programming languages such as C/C++, JAVA, Python, Perl, etc. and
    can learn these languages from various online or offline resources.
    Furthermore, you’re also recommended to get proficient with several
    prominent Operating Systems such as Linux, UNIX, etc. along with the
    respective tools & commands.

<h3 class="pClass">
  <b>2. Learn about SQL Queries & Databases</b>
  <p>
    Okay, let’s move to another prominent technical skill that you need to
    possess for being a worthwhile Automation Testing Professional –
    understanding of SQL Queries and Databases. You’re required to be proficient
    with fundamental Structured Query Language (SQL) concepts such as Data
    Manipulation Language (DML), Data Definition Language (DDL), Transactional
    Control Language, Aggregate Functions, etc. along with the Database concepts
    and operations. Though you’re not required to have a deep understanding of
    all relational databases and you can start with Oracle, MySQL, etc. to
    understand the database management processes. Moreover, you’re also required
    to have familiarity with several data formats such as XML, JSON, etc to get
    more exposure in the Testing domain.
  </p>
</h3>
<h3 class="pClass">
  <b>3. Understand the Automation Testing Concepts</b>
  <p>
    Now, let’s dive deeper into the ocean of Automation Testing – you’re
    required to understand various crucial and prerequisite Automation Testing
    concepts. First and foremost, you need to go through the Automation Testing
    Life Cycle (ATLC) concept and the respective processes. In general, ATLC is
    concerned with the structural testing process that comprises several stages
    for all the required activities for testing. The various phases of ATLC are
    as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Defining the scope of Test Automation</li>
    <li>Picking out the relevant Automation Tools</li>
    <li>Development of Test Plan, Design & Strategy</li>
    <li>Setting Up of Test Environment</li>
    <li>Development & Execution of Automation Test Script</li>
    <li>Test Analysis & Generating Test Reports</li>
  </ol>
  Along with ATLC, you’re required to focus on several additional concepts also
  such as Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery for Testing,
  understanding of APIs, etc. for some advanced outlook in Automation Testing.
